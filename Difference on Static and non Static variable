Q. What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it 
	with an example?

Answer:- A static variable is the variable that acts as a global variable and is shared among all 
the objects of the class. A non-static variables are specific to instance object in which they 
are created.

	Difference between static and non static variable are as follow ---

1. Static members belong to the class, whereas non-static members belong to
	the object.
2. All objects of a class share a single copy of static variables whereas Each object has one 
	local copy of the non-static variables.

   We can access static members of a class by using the following 3 ways:
	1. Directly by their name (only inside the same class)
	2. By using the object
	3. By using the class name (even inside another class also).
